Dear Prof. CHAN,  

I am reaching out to kindly request your supervision for my upcoming project based on your experience in successfully overseeing similar projects in previous academic year。

My proposal involves developing Japanese learning application tailored for users who are preparing JLPT test。 

Below is my proposal：

Project Title: JLPT Preparation Application

Subject Area: Mobile application, Mobile application development

Abstract：

Japanese-Language Proficiency Test(JLPT) is a test to evaluate and certify Japanese language proficiency of non-native speaker. On the internet, there are a wide range of materials helping people to learn Japanese, like Duolingo helping user to learn Japanese words. However, it is not efficient for JLPT participants to prepare the test through the internet because many of the resources are not designed for JLPT test. Also, the resources are not centralized and well-organized. It makes JLPT participants need to spend extra time to look for the resources they want.

To address the two problems mentioned above, the project aims to develop a mobile application helping users to prepare for the JLPT test. The application will provides all the contents covered by the JLPT test and the contents are well-organized. Also, the application will provide several features to help the user to study.

Objectives:

1. Provide materials and resources for N5-N3 test.

2.
